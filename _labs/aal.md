The Alamire Analytic Lab is a 2D spatial auralization lab specifically targeted at the auralization of multitrack recordings of early vocal music.

The lab is located in the Saint Norbert's Gate at the Park Abbey site in Leuven, and is jointly exploited by the Alamire Foundation and the KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab. The lab is primarily used by musicologists, music performers, and audio engineering researchers. It is mainly intended to achieve spatial auralization of multi-track recordings, hence facilitating the analysis and interpretation of polyphonic music by spatially separating the voices.

The realisation of the lab has been largely supported by a Large-Scale Research Infrastructure grant of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO, Project No. I013218N).
