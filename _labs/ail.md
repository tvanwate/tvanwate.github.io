The Alamire Interactive Lab is a 3D interactive spatial auralization lab specifically targeted at the real-time auralization of virtual acoustics in the context of early music performance.

The lab is located in the Saint Norbert's Gate at the Park Abbey site in Leuven, and is jointly exploited by the Alamire Foundation and the KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab. The lab is primarily used by music performers, media technologists and audio engineering researchers. The audio setup in the lab allows for multi-microphone audio capture, high-performance and low-latency audio processing, and multi-channel loudspeaker playback. All of these components are integrated in a Dante-based audio network. The audio processing component is mainly intended for real-time auralization of virtual acoustics, such that artificial or reproduced spatial reverberation can be added to sounds produced and captured inside the lab. The main use case is to provide early music performers with the possibility of singing in virtual or reproduced church acoustics, with the purpose of analyzing the impact of the acoustics on early music performance.

The realisation of the lab has been largely supported by a Large-Scale Research Infrastructure grant of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO, Project No. I013218N).
