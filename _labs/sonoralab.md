The SONORA Audio Lab is an acoustic measurement and reproduction lab designed to perform experiments with moving sound sources and observers in reverberant conditions.

The lab is located in the KU Leuven Electrical Engineering Department (ESAT) at the Arenberg Campus in Leuven, and is exploited by the KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab. The lab is primarily used by audio engineering and signal processing researchers. The audio setup in the lab allows for 32-channel synchronous audio acquisition and 24-channel synchronous audio playback. The lab consists of an L-shaped reverberant measurement room and a separate control room.

The realisation of the lab has been largely supported by KU Leuven and most of the equipment has been funded by a Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council (ERC, Grant Agreement No. 773268).
