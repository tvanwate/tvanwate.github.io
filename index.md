## KU Leuven Nou Audio Engineering Lab
The KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab engages in signal processing research for audio, speech, music, and acoustics applications. The Lab currently hosts 14 international PhD and postdoc researchers and participates in several nationally and internationally funded research projects, ranging from fundamental research to industry-funded applied research. The Lab is headed by Toon van Waterschoot is affiliated to two research labs at the KU Leuven Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT): the Stadius Centre for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics, and the e-Media Research Lab.

## Toon van Waterschoot
Toon van Waterschoot received MSc (2001) and PhD (2009) degrees in Electrical Engineering, both from KU Leuven, Belgium, where he is currently an Associate Professor and Consolidator Grantee of the European Research Council (ERC). He has previously also held teaching and research positions at Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands and the University of Lugano in Switzerland. His research interests are in signal processing, machine learning, and numerical optimization, applied to acoustic signal enhancement, acoustic modeling, audio analysis, and audio reproduction.
