The KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab carries out **signal processing research** in the context of **audio, speech, music, and acoustics applications**. The Lab currently hosts 14 international PhD and postdoc researchers and participates in several nationally and internationally funded research projects, ranging from fundamental research to industry-funded applied research. The Lab is headed by [Toon van Waterschoot](toonvanwaterschoot.md) and is affiliated to two research labs at the KU Leuven Department of Electrical Engineering ([ESAT](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/english/overview)): the [Stadius Centre for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/) and the [e-Media Research Lab](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/emedia/home).

## Toon van Waterschoot
Toon van Waterschoot received MSc (2001) and PhD (2009) degrees in Electrical Engineering, both from [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), Belgium, where he is currently an Associate Professor and Consolidator Grantee of the European Research Council ([ERC](https://erc.europa.eu)). He has previously also held teaching and research positions at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) in The Netherlands and the [University of Lugano](https://www.usi.ch/en) in Switzerland. His research interests are in signal processing, machine learning, and numerical optimization, applied to acoustic signal enhancement, acoustic modeling, audio analysis, and audio reproduction.
