# KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab
The KU Leuven audio engineering group headed by Prof. Toon van Waterschoot is affiliated to two research labs at the Electrical Engineering Department, i.e. the Stadius Centre for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing and Data Analytics, and the e-Media Research Lab. The audio engineering group carries out signal processing research in the context of audio, speech, music, and acoustics applications. The group currently hosts about 10 international PhD and postdoc researchers and participates in several nationally and internationally funded research projects, ranging from fundamental research to industry-funded applied research.
