Toon van Waterschoot is the **Principal Investigator** of the KU Leuven Audio Engineering Lab. He is currently an Associate Professor and Consolidator Grantee of the European Research Council (ERC) at KU Leuven.

## Biography
As of 2018, I am an Associate Professor at  [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/) , Belgium. I am affiliated to the Stadius Center for Dynamical Systems, Signal Processing, and Data Analytics ( [STADIUS](http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius) ) as well as to the  [e-Media Research Lab](https://iiw.kuleuven.be/onderzoek/emedia)  of the Department of Electrical Engineering ( [ESAT](http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/) ).

In 2001, I graduated as a Master in Electrical Engineering at KU Leuven, after which I spent a year as a teaching assistant with the  [Hogere Zeevaartschool Antwerpen](http://www.hzs.be/) , Belgium. One year later, in 2002, I returned to KU Leuven to start a PhD research project on signal processing applied to audio and acoustics, funded by the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation through Science and Technology in Flanders ( [IWT-Vlaanderen](http://www.iwt.be/) ), which I succesfully terminated in 2009 under the supervision of Prof.  [Marc Moonen](http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius/person.php?view=0&persid=2) . In 2010, I moved to  [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/) , The Netherlands, where I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with Prof.  [Geert Leus](http://cas.et.tudelft.nl/~leus/) , working on distributed signal processing for wireless sensor networks. In 2011, I received a Postdoctoral Fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders ( [FWO-Vlaanderen](http://www.fwo.be/) ), which enabled me to return again to KU Leuven for initiating a 3-year research program on acoustic signal enhancement in cooperation with Prof. Marc Moonen and Prof.  [Moritz Diehl](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~mdiehl/) . In 2013, I was appointed as an Assistant Professor at KU Leuven, Belgium, where I am currently supervising a team of researchers working in the field of audio engineering and signal processing. From 2013 to 2016, I have also been serving as a Scientific Coordinator for the FP7-PEOPLE Marie Curie Initial Training Network “Dereverberation and Reverberation of Audio, Music, and Speech ( [DREAMS](http://www.dreams-itn.eu/) )” funded by the  [European Commission](http://ec.europa.eu/euraxess/) . In 2017, I have been awarded a Consolidator Grant by the European Research Council (ERC), which allows me and my research team to explore the analysis and synthesis of complex dynamic sound scenes in the ERC project “The Spatial Dynamics of Room Acoustics (SONORA)”, 2018-2023. I have been teaching digital signal processing (with Prof. Marc Moonen and Prof.  [Søren Holdt Jensen](http://kom.aau.dk/~shj/) ) at the Advanced Learning and Research Institute ( [ALaRI](http://www.alari.ch/) ) of the University of Lugano, Switzerland, optimization in the  [Faculty of Engineering Science](http://eng.kuleuven.be/)  at KU Leuven, and digital signal processing, control theory, signals & systems, multimedia, and linear algebra & geometry in the  [Faculty of Engineering Techology](http://iiw.kuleuven.be/)  at the KU Leuven  [Campus Geel](http://iiw.kuleuven.be/geel)  and  [Campus Group T](http://iiw.kuleuven.be/groupt) .

Next to my academic career, I’ve been spending quite some time studying and playing music. I’ve been involved in the composition and performance of a wide range of musical styles, from experimental trash rock over electronic music to classical and early music. I started studying music at the age of 8, and since then I’ve been performing and touring with a number of rock bands, small ensembles, and orchestras, in Belgium as well as abroad. I’ve been lucky to have several inspiring musical mentors with whom I’ve been studying brass instruments (flugelhorn, bass), string instruments (guitar, violin), and keyboard instruments (piano, organ). In 2001, I obtained a violin diploma (summa cum laude) in the Flemish part-time music education program. Since 2012, I’ve been again enrolled in such a program, now studying the  [organ](http://www.orgelherentals.be/)  and focusing on early music.
Finally, I also enjoy  [renovating old houses](https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/dibe/relict/209127) , volunteering in all kinds of organizations, and of course spending time with my wife and three kids.
